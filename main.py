#Project information
#  Project title: Flash Card Program (aka Never Baguette)
#  Purpose: There are a multitude of resources available to students to make flash cards, but our goal with Never Baguette was to expand the userâ€™s capabilities. This
#    program allows those who use it to create flash cards for effective studying.  Users just have to follow simple instructions to create decks of cards. The program
#    will let them view, edit, and delete decks that they make. It saves paper since everything is done on the computer.  This program will assist countless students on 
#    their quests for knowledge.
